## Exercise 3
# 1. Declare your age as integer variable
# 2. Declare your height as a float variable
# 3. Declare a variable that store a complex number
# 4. Write a script that prompts the user to enter base and height of the triangle and calculate an area of this triangle (area = 0.5 x b x h).

# ```py
#     Enter base: 20
#     Enter height: 10
#     The area of the triangle is 100
# ```
# age = 34
# height = 10
# myNum = ai + 8j

base = float(input('Enter the base of the triangle: '))
height = float(input('Enter the height of the triangle:'))
area = 0.5 * height * base
print('The area of the triangle is: ', area)
